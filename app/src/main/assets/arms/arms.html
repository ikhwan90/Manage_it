<p><strong><em>Instructions</em></strong><strong style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>

<ol>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you
        between your legs. Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">Use your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back
        of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh. Rotate the palm of your hand
        until it is facing forward away from your thigh. <strong>Tip:</strong> Your arm should be
        extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights
        forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move.
        Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at
        shoulder level. <strong>Tip:</strong> At the top of the movement make sure that the little
        finger of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the
        contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting
        position as your breathe in. <strong>Caution:</strong> Avoid swinging motions at any time.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Then
        repeat the movement with the left arm.
    </li>
</ol>
</p><p><strong>Variations:</strong> This exercise can be performed standing with the torso bent
    forward and the arm in front of you. In this case, no leg support is used for the back of your
    arm so you will need to make extra effort to ensure no movement of the upper arm. This is a more
    challenging version of the exercise and is not recommended for people with lower back issues.

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">To begin, set a weight that is comfortable on each side of
        the pulley machine. <strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that the amount of weight selected is
        the same on each side.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">Now adjust the height of the pulleys on each side and make
        sure that they are positioned at a height higher than that of your shoulders.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">Stand in the middle of both sides and use an underhand grip
        (palms facing towards the ceiling) to grab each handle. Your arms should be fully extended
        and parallel to the floor with your feet positioned shoulder width apart from each other.
        Your body should be evenly aligned the handles. This is the starting position.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">While exhaling, slowly squeeze the biceps on each side
        until your forearms and biceps touch.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">While inhaling, move your forearms back to the starting
        position. <strong>Note:</strong> Your entire body is stationary during this exercise except
        for the forearms.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep">Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions prescribed
        in your program.
    </li>
</ol>
</p><p><strong>Variations:</strong> This exercise can also be performed using one handle at a time.
