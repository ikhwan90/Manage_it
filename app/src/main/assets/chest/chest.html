<h2 id="Crunches">1.Dumbbell Bench Press</h2>

<p><strong><em>Dumbbell Bench Press Instructions</em></strong><strong
        style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The
        palms of your hands will be facing each other.
    </li>
    <li> Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so
        that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width.
    </li>
    <li>Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are
        facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your
        upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the
        dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position.
    </li>
    <li>Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top
        of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly.
        Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Caution</em></strong><strong
        style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator
    cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.

    Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of
    your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both
    dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the
    dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the
    dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get
    back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you
    can place the dumbbells on the floor.</p>

<p><strong><em>Variations:</em></strong><strong style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>

<p>Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each
    other.

    Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist
    as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the
    body.</p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Once you get used to the regular crunches, modify the basic crunch to get an even more effective
    tummy exercise.</p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of
        your hands will be facing each other.
    </li>
    <li>Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so
        that you can hold them at shoulder width.
    </li>
    <li>Once you have the dumbbells raised to shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the
        palms of your hands are facing away from you.This will be your starting position.
    </li>
    <li>Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Then breathe out and push the
        dumbbells up with your chest.
    </li>
    <li>Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip
        Ideally, lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li>
    <li>When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor. This is
        the safest manner to release the dumbbells.
    </li>
</ol>
</p><p><strong>Variations:</strong> You can use several angles on the incline bench if the bench you
    are using is adjustable.</p>
<p>Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each
    other.</p>
<p>Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist
    as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the
    body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my
    shoulders.</p>


<h2 id="SideCrunch">3.Low Cable Crossover:</h2>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_230486" style="width: 610px">&nbsp;</div>

        href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/"
        rel="attachment wp-att-230486"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> </span></a></p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>To move into the starting position, place the pulleys at the low position, select the
        resistance to be used and grasp a handle in each hand.
    </li>
    <li>Step forward, gaining tension in the pulleys. Your palms should be facing forward, hands
        below the waist, and your arms straight. This will be your starting position.
    </li>
    <li>With a slight bend in your arms, draw your hands upward and toward the midline of your body.
        Your hands should come together in front of your chest, palms facing up.
    </li>
    <li>Return your arms back to the starting position after a brief pause.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="ReverseCrunches">4.Decline Dumbbell Flyes :</h2>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to do reverse crunches. This is another good exercise to reduce belly
    fat.</p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_230481" style="width: 610px">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="content_4.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 92px;"/> <a
        href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/"
        rel="attachment wp-att-230481"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> </span></a></p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand
        on top of your thighs.The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
    </li>
    <li> Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width. The palms
        of the hands should be facing each other and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor
        and fully extended. This will be your starting position.
    </li>
    <li> With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower
        your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in
        as you perform this portion of the movement. <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep in mind that
        throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur
        at the shoulder joint.
    </li>
    <li> Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and
        breathe out. <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the
        weights.
    </li>
    <li> Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed
        amount of repetitions.
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Variation:</strong> You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different
    stimulation.</p>

<h2 id="VerticalLegCrunch">5.Decline Barbell Bench</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="clear"><img alt="" src="content_5.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 186px;"/></div>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep"> Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and
        slowly lay down on the bench.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep"> Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree
        angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar
        from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. The arms should be
        perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. <strong>Tip:</strong> In
        order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the
        barbell off the rack.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep"> As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar
        on your lower chest.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep"> After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting
        position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and
        squeeze your chest in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down
        slowly again. <strong>Tip:</strong> It should take at least twice as long to go down than to
        come up).
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep"> Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of
        repetitions.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep"> When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.</li>
</ol>
</p>  <strong>Caution:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep"> If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you
        use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight
        used.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep"> Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You
        want the bar to touch your lower chest and nowhere else.
    </li>
    <li class="ExDetail-descriptionStep"> Don't bounce the weight off your chest. You should be in
        full control of the barbell at all times.
    </li>
</ul>
</p><p><strong>Variations:</strong> You can also use dumbbells or exercise bands to perform this
    exercise.</p>
