<h2 id="Crunches">1. Crunches:</h2>

<p>Nothing burns belly fat faster than crunches, which occupy the number one position in fat-burning
    exercises. Now, it&rsquo;s time that you start performing this exercise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="lybrate-top lybratens"><img alt="" src="content_1.jpg"
                                      style="width: 300px; height: 151px;"/></p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong><strong
        style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Lie down flat on a mat with your knees bent and feet on the ground. Alternatively, you can
        also lift your legs off the floor at a 90-degree angle. (See picture).
    </li>
    <li>Lift your hands and place them behind your head, or keep them crossed on your chest.</li>
    <li>Inhale deeply, and as you lift your upper torso off the floor, exhale.</li>
    <li>Inhale again as you get back down, and exhale as you come up.</li>
    <li>Do this for 10 times as a beginner.</li>
    <li>Repeat another two to three sets.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Variations</em></strong><strong
        style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>Dumbbell crossover punch, shoulder press and side crunch, butterfly crunch.</p>

<p><strong><em>Precautions</em></strong><strong style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>

<p>While performing crunches, instead of entering the full sit-up position, just raise your back a
    few inches from the ground. This ensures you don&rsquo;t hurt your back.</p>

<p>Also, don&rsquo;t jerk your head forward while doing crunches. This will put pressure on your
    neck and result in pain. Just hold your hands above your head and perform the exercise.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tip: </em></strong>As you lift your torso, do not sit up straight. Your back should
    make an angle of 30-40 degrees with the ground. Only then you will feel pressure on your
    abdominal muscles.</p>

<h2 id="TwistCrunches">2. Twist Crunches:</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="content_2.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 206px;"/>&nbsp; <a
        href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/"
        rel="attachment wp-att-230521"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> </span></a></p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Once you get used to the regular crunches, modify the basic crunch to get an even more effective
    tummy exercise.</p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Lie down on the floor with your hands behind your head.</li>
    <li>Bend your knees as you would do in crunches, keeping your feet on the floor.</li>
    <li>You have to lift your upper torso while performing crunches. But, in twist crunches, you
        have to lift just your right shoulder towards the left, keeping the left side of your torso
        on the ground.
    </li>
    <li>Again alternately, lift your left shoulder towards the right, keeping the right side of your
        torso on the ground.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat 10 times.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="SideCrunch">3. Side Crunch:</h2>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_230486" style="width: 610px">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp; <img alt="" src="content_3.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 110px;"/> <a
        href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/"
        rel="attachment wp-att-230486"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> </span></a></p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<p>This is same as the twist crunch exercise. The only difference is that you need to tilt your legs
    to the same side simultaneously with your shoulders. The side crunch focuses on the muscles on
    your sides.</p>

<p><strong><em>Precautions </em></strong></p>

<p>Make sure you keep your movements steady and slow. The midsection, being a complex area, could
    hurt if you perform the twists in a hurried fashion.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="ReverseCrunches">4. Reverse Crunches:</h2>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to do reverse crunches. This is another good exercise to reduce belly
    fat.</p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_230481" style="width: 610px">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="" src="content_4.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 92px;"/> <a
        href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/"
        rel="attachment wp-att-230481"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> </span></a></p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<p>This is similar to the twist crunch exercise. The only thing that you need to do is tilt your
    legs behind simultaneously with your shoulders. The side crunch focuses on the muscles on your
    sides.</p>

<p><strong><em>Precautions </em></strong></p>

<p>Keep your back straight while performing the exercise, as arching it can result in pain, and in
    some cases, even injury.</p>

<h2 id="VerticalLegCrunch">5. Vertical Leg Crunch:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="clear"><img alt="" src="content_5.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 186px;"/></div>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Lie flat on the floor, or on the mat, with your legs extended upwards (towards the ceiling)
        and one knee crossed over the other.
    </li>
    <li>Now that you have positioned your body perfectly, do the same as you would have done in the
        case of crunches. That is, breathe in and lift your upper body from the floor towards the
        pelvis.
    </li>
    <li>Breathe out slowly. As you bring yourself down, breathe in again, and exhale as you go up.
    </li>
    <li>Do 12 to 15 reps and up to three sets.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Precautions</em></strong><strong style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>

<p>Start by doing only a few repetitions of this exercise, as it can make you feel sore if you
    overdo it initially.</p>

<h2 id="BicycleExercise">6. Bicycle Exercise:</h2>

<p>No, you don&rsquo;t need a bicycle for this. Thinking how you can do this? We&rsquo;ll tell
    you.</p>

<p>&nbsp; <img alt="" src="content_6.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 139px;"/> <a
        href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/"
        rel="attachment wp-att-221231"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> </span></a></p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Lie on the floor and keep your hands either by your sides or behind your head as you do in
        crunches.
    </li>
    <li>Lift both your legs off the ground and bend them at the knees.</li>
    <li>Bring your right knee close to your chest, keeping your left leg away.</li>
    <li>Now take your right leg away and bring your left leg close to your chest.</li>
    <li>Keep doing this as if you are paddling a bicycle.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="LungeTwist">7. Lunge Twist:</h2>

<p>This is a workout for beginners who want to reduce belly fat quickly.</p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_230522" style="width: 610px">&nbsp;</div>

<p><img alt="" src="content_8.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 193px;"/>&nbsp; <a
        href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/"
        rel="attachment wp-att-230522"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> </span></a></p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Stand with your legs hip width apart. Keep your knees slightly bent.</li>
    <li>Lift both your hands in front of you, aligning them with your shoulders and keeping them
        parallel to the ground.
    </li>
    <li>Lunge forward as shown in the picture. Take a big step forward with your right leg, and sit
        down as if on a chair so that your knees make a 90-degree angle with the floor. The left leg
        should be positioned backwards, supported by the toes.
    </li>
    <li>The spine should be kept straight. Don&rsquo;t bend your spine forward.</li>
    <li>Twist your torso (just the torso, and not the legs) to the right and then to the left.</li>
    <li>Repeat 15 times.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="RollingPlankExercise">8. Rolling Plank Exercise:</h2>

<p>&nbsp; <img alt="" src="content_9.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 186px;"/> <a
        href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/"
        rel="attachment wp-att-230483"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> </span></a></p>

<div style="float:right;">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The rolling plank trains the muscles around your abdomen, hip, and lower back.</p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Position yourself on the floor with your knees and elbows resting on the ground.</li>
    <li>Keep your neck aligned with your spine. Look forward.</li>
    <li>Lift the knees up and support your legs on the toes.</li>
    <li>Contract your knees and keep breathing normally.</li>
    <li>This is the plank pose. Stay in this posture for 30 seconds.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, start moving to and fro for the next 30 seconds. This is the rolling plank exercise.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Lie down on the floor sideways.</li>
    <li>Support yourself on your right elbow and right leg. Your elbow should be perpendicular to
        the shoulder, and the left leg should be above the right leg, keeping them together.
    </li>
    <li>Keep your knees straight. Your hips should not be touching the ground.</li>
    <li>Hold this position for 30 seconds. Once you get comfortable, you may hold this for one to
        two minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Repeat on the other side too.</li>
</ol>

<p>While you are in this position, you may also lift the leg on the top and bring it down again.
    This makes the exercise more effective &ndash; it works not only your abs, but also your thighs
    and hips.</p>

<p><strong><em>Variations </em></strong></p>

<p>Knee plank, rocking plank, reverse plank.</p>

<p><strong><em>Precautions </em></strong></p>

<p>Plank is a strenuous exercise, and you might feel like holding your breath while performing it.
    But don&rsquo;t do that, as you might suffer from nausea or dizziness.</p>

<h2 id="TheStomachVacuum">9. The Stomach Vacuum:</h2>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_248822" style="width: 610px"><img alt=""
                                                                                     src="content_10.jpg"
                                                                                     style="width: 300px; height: 170px;"/>
</div>

<p>Stomach vacuum exercises are low-impact exercises that place greater emphasis on breathing
    instead of increasing your heart rate.</p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<p>a. This is similar to what we call the cat stretch pose. This is also known as the four-point,
    transverse-abdominal stomach vacuum. Follow the steps mentioned below to do this exercise for
    reducing belly fat:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go down to the ground on all fours, supporting your body on your hands and knees.</li>
    <li>Inhale deeply and loosen your abdomen.</li>
    <li>As you exhale, tighten the abdomen muscles.</li>
    <li>Hold this position for 15-30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process.</li>
</ol>

<p>b. Another type of stomach vacuum exercise is elevators. Here&rsquo;s how to do it:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Sit on a chair. Imagine your belly to be an elevator that&rsquo;s moving up.</li>
    <li>Now inhale deeply using only your nose and think that it&rsquo;s the first floor.</li>
    <li>Breathe out using your mouth and simultaneously push your belly towards your spine,
        imagining that you are going up to the fifth floor.
    </li>
    <li>Breathe out fast five more times, squeezing your abs every time you exhale.</li>
    <li>Repeat the same five more times.</li>
</ol>

<p>c. You can try standing pelvic tilts. This is another form of stomach vacuum exercise.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Stand with your legs hip width apart and bend your knees slightly.</li>
    <li>Inhale deeply through your nose and push your belly inwards towards your spine, and at the
        same time, roll your hips out in the front.
    </li>
    <li>Do five to six sets.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Variations </em></strong></p>

<p>Seated stomach vacuum, functional stomach vacuum.</p>

<p><strong><em>Precautions </em></strong></p>

<p>If you are suffering from any heart or lung ailment, it is best to avoid performing this
    exercise.</p>

<p>This exercise must be performed only on an empty stomach, as doing otherwise might lead to
    indigestion.</p>

<h2 id="CaptainsChair">10. Captain&rsquo;s Chair:</h2>

<p>&nbsp; <img alt="" src="content_11.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 226px;"/>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All you need to do this exercise is a chair.</p>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Sit on the chair with your spine straight and shoulders relaxed.</li>
    <li>Keep both hands beside you with your palms by the side of your hips, facing downward.</li>
    <li>Inhale deeply.</li>
    <li>As you exhale, bring both your legs upwards such that your knees are close to your chest.
        Hold for five seconds. Don&rsquo;t bend forward and arch your back.
    </li>
    <li>Bring down your legs slowly and repeat.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Variations</em></strong><strong
        style="line-height: 1.7; font-size: 1rem;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>Hanging knee raises, lying leg raise.</p>

<h2 id="BendingSideToSide">11. Bending Side To Side:</h2>

<p>This is yet another perfect exercise for reducing belly fat.</p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_227637" style="width: 610px"><img alt=""
                                                                                     src="content_12.jpg"
                                                                                     style="width: 300px; height: 223px;"/>
</div>

<p><strong><em>How To Do</em></strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Stand erect with your feet together and keep your hands to the sides.</li>
    <li>Keeping your legs grounded, bend your body to the right as much as possible till you feel a
        strain on your left waist. As you do so, ensure your right hand is on the right hip, and the
        left hand is raised upwards. Stay in the position for 15 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>Return to the original position.</li>
    <li>Now bend to the left, and retain the position for another 15 seconds.</li>
</ol>

<p>Slowly, you may increase the holding time to 30 seconds.</p>

<h2>Cardio Exercises:</h2>

<p>&nbsp; <a href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/5-exercises-and-5-foods-to-reduce-belly-fat/"
             rel="attachment wp-att-223429"><span class="imgshare_buttons"> <img alt=""
                                                                                 src="content_13.jpg"
                                                                                 style="width: 300px; height: 199px;"/></span></a>
</p>

<p>Cardio is one of the most effective ways to burn calories and shed unwanted flab from your body.
    Cardio exercises are immensely helpful in reducing belly fat. Doing cardio on a regular basis
    will offer you other health benefits such as reduction of stress, an increase in your lung
    capacity, better sleep, and a sense of overall well-being.</p>

<h3 id="Walking">12. Walking:</h3>

<p>One of the very first cardio exercises to reduce belly fat is walking. Surprised? Do you think it&rsquo;s
    too simple to be effective? Well, then you should know that walking is a great and effective way
    to burn away that ugly belly fat. In fact, it is an excellent fat burner for your entire body.
    If you follow a healthy diet&nbsp;along with walking at a steady pace for 30-45 minutes for at
    least four to five days every week, you will witness a gradual decrease in your weight.</p>

<p>This low-impact exercise increases your metabolism as well as your heart rate. A heightened
    metabolic rate will burn away calories at a faster pace, thus helping to eliminate the fat
    accumulated around your belly. In fact, walking decreases the risk of injuries and is considered
    to be a good workout for beginners.</p>

<h3 id="Running">13. Running:</h3>

<p>You have to prevent your body from getting used to any fixed workout routine. Hence, you can
    switch occasionally. Try running for a change. It is an effective way to keep your heart rate
    up, burn calories, and lose belly fat.</p>

<h3 id="Jogging">14. Jogging:</h3>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t like running, try jogging instead. Research suggests that jogging is more
    effective in breaking down unwanted fat when compared to weightlifting. This is a form of
    aerobic exercise that is extremely useful for fighting obesity and staying fit.</p>

<h3 id="Cycling">15. Cycling:</h3>

<p>This is another effective cardio exercise that helps you shed belly fat by burning calories.
    Ensure that your heart rate goes up while you are cycling.</p>

<h3 id="Swimming">16. Swimming:</h3>

<p>With&nbsp;swimming,&nbsp;you get the benefits of cardio &ndash; from losing weight to toning your
    body &ndash; all at the same time! The strokes you choose should be up-tempo and strenuous in
    order to&nbsp;help you burn more calories. You can start by going for a swim once or twice every
    week.</p>

<p>Follow these effective and simple exercises to reduce belly fat. You can easily do most of these
    exercises at home without the help of any personal trainer. All you need is determination and a
    lot of stamina. Reducing tummy fat is no longer an elusive dream!</p>
